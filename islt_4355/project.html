    <h4 id="BoeingHeader">Boing Defense, Space, and Security
        Industrial Engineering Intern
        June 10, 2022 – August 19, 2022
        </h4>

    <p>Description:
        Boeing is a global company that creates a variety of products in the Commercial, Defense, and Space sectors. During the Summer of 2022, I interned at Boeing Defense, Space, and Security. The location in which I worked was Berkeley, Missouri. During my time there, I worked as an Industrial Engineering Intern. I was tasked with completing several projects relating to the production of a product. I worked with shop workers, engineers, and managers on my projects. To complete projects, I used Industrial Engineering techniques. These techniques include time standards, facility layout, and job scheduling. While I first learned these techniques in school, I was able to apply them into the workplace.
        </p>

    <p>Reflection:
        During my time at Boeing Defense, Space, and Security, I had a great time learning and working for the company. I enjoyed applying the concepts I’ve learned at the University of Missouri to a real workplace. At Boeing, I enjoyed learning more about the products and culture of the company. I formed great relationships with my coworkers, which made my experience even better. I am very excited to return after I graduate.

        University of Missouri College of Engineering
        Undergraduate Researcher
        Summer/Fall 2021 – Spring 2022
        </h4>

    <p>Description:
        The University College of Engineering has a large emphasis in Undergraduate and Graduate Research. Students are heavily encouraged to join on of these research programs. During the Summer before my Junior year, as well as during both semesters of my Junior year, I worked on Undergraduate Research. The project title was “Developing the Automated System to Extract Nurses’ EMR Usage Profiles Using R Shiny.” This project was in collaboration with the University of Missouri School of Nursing, in which the data was extracted. Specifically, Electronic Medical Record (EMR) data was extracted for the project. The goal of the project was to create an interactive dashboard about nurse behavior on the EMR system. This dashboard was created using the R programming language, as well as the R Shiny dashboard.
        </p>

    <p>Reflection:
        During my time and an Undergraduate Research Student, I worked with a team of three other students. We all worked with two professors to complete the project. Through this project, I learned a lot about coding in R. I also learned how to make a dashboard in R studio. These tools are important in data analytics, which is one of my interests with Industrial and Systems Engineering. I also formed relationships with other students and the professors on the project.

        Student Ambassador
        2022 – Present
        
        </h4>

        <p>Description:
            The University of Missouri College of Engineering Ambassador Program consists of Engineering students that represent the College of Engineering. The main responsibility of these students is to give tours and help prospective students. The prospective students could be high school students or transfer students. The goal of the Ambassador Program is to provide a unique and personalized experience to these prospective students. This experience helps prospective students get a better experience of the College of Engineering culture and expectations. In addition to this, the Ambassadors hold office hours. These office hours consist of various tasks, such as contacting prospective students, organizing shirts, etc.
            </p>

        <p>Reflection:
            The University of Missouri College of Engineering Ambassador Program has been an enjoyable experience. I enjoy helping prospective students and answering questions. I have also formed relationships with University of Missouri Engineering Students and Staff. This program has allowed me to gain valuable leadership experience within the College of Engineering.
