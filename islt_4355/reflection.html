    <h2>University Experience</h2>

    <p>During my four years at the University of Missouri, I have learned a lot about 
Engineering. During my freshman year of College, I was an Undeclared Engineer. I did not 
know what type of Engineering I wanted to pursue. I joined an Engineering 1000 course, which 
discussed all the types of Engineering majors. I found this class very useful to find what I did or 
did not enjoy. From this class, I found that I enjoyed Industrial and Systems Engineering. Before 
College, I was not familiar with this type of Engineering. Industrial and Systems Engineering 
describes how any system functions. This could be in manufacturing, healthcare, commercial, 
etc. Additionally, data analytics plays a key role in this major. I found that I enjoy probability 
and statistics, which both play a critical role in systems. From my education at the University of 
Missouri, I am confident in my abilities for the workplace. </p>

  <p>In addition to learning about Engineering at the University of Missouri, I have also 
formed many relationships. During my freshman year, I joined a Freshman Interest Group (FIG). 
In the FIG, I lived in the same building as other Engineering students. We had many of the same 
generic classes and Engineering classes. This allowed us to work together and help each other. I 
found this valuable in my classes. In addition to this, I participated in Undergraduate Research. I 
worked in a team with three other students and two professors. This further improved my 
teamwork skills by collaborating with teammates. By collaborating with teammates, we were 
able to complete work on time. The relationships I formed at the University of Missouri help me 
work better in teams, which will help in the workplace.</p>

    <h2>Work Experience</h2>

  <p>My internship at Boeing Defense, Space, and Security provided me with industry 
experience in Industrial Engineering. Boeing is an industry leader in producing products in the 
commercial, defense, and space sectors. During my internship, I applied my Industrial 
Engineering education to complete projects. I used my skills in forming relationships to better 
work in teams. I had a great experience working for Boeing Defense, Space, and Security. I look 
forward to returning after I graduate.</p>

 <p>In the future, I want to be an Engineering Manager. Specifically, I want to manage people 
on Engineering projects. I enjoy the idea of influencing an Engineering project. This is because I 
want to manage a project that makes a difference in the world. By starting my career with Boeing 
Defense, Space, and Security, I will be able to achieve my career goals.</p>
