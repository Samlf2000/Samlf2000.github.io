    <h3> Description </h3>

<p> My name is Sam Forrest. I am from Columbia, Missouri. I am a Senior majoring in Industrial and Systems Engineering. I have attended the University of Missouri for my entire college career. I enjoy learning about statistical analysis, Six Sigma, and simulation in my major.<br><br>Over the summer I interned at Boeing Defense, Space, and Security. I found that software programs like Microsoft Excel are applicable in the workforce.  After graduating college, I will work at Boeing Defense, Space, and Security. In this position, I will be an Industrial Engineer.<br><br>In my free time, I enjoy playing video games and cars. Over the previous summer, I researched and built a computer. This venture helped me learn about computer hardware, as well as how computers function. In addition to this, I enjoy cars. Recently, I have been researching the next car I want to buy. It is exciting to build cars on a website and search for cars. </p>
