     My name is Sam Forrest. I am a Senior Industrial and Systems Engineering student attending the University of Missouri. I will be working as an Industrial Engineer at Boeing Defense, Space, and Security after college. I do not have any previous web development training or experience. However, I have experience in programming languages such as C, R, and Python. My expectations for this course are to learn HTML and CSS. I want to have some experience with front end development. While my major and career path will likely not use any of these web development skills, I still want to be literate in this field. It is possible my job will require me to have a basic understanding of web development at some point during my career. My favorite hobby is playing video games. Over the summer, I researched and built a computer for this purpose.
